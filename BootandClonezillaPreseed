#######STEPS BEFORE PREPARE PRESEED FILE FOR NETWORK BOOT############
-----------Network BOOT (PXE Booting)--------------
We need DHCP and TFTP server. Boot computer get ip address, PXEboot file address etc. from DHCP server. Mission of TFTP server is
to store Debian image or what you boot it. First of all , we need to configure DHCP and TFTP settings. We use Virtualbox 6.0 to 
make machine and using Ubuntu 18.04 Live Server for make DHCP and TFTP server.

-------------Configuring DHCP settings------------
We come DHCP server , and install isc-dhcp-server packet.  you can do this following code:

sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server

If install it, we should start it. We can do  this code,

sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server

Now, we open giving directory file using what you want text editor, ı am using nano

sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

and add this following code:
#------------------------------------------
allow booting;
allow bootp;
authoritative;

subnet 10.0.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 10.0.2.50 10.0.2.99; 
  filename "pxelinux.0";
  option tftp-server-name "10.0.2.102";
  option bootfile-name "pxelinux.0";
  option routers 10.0.2.1;
  next-server 10.0.2.102;
}
#------------------------------------------
and save it.
Explaining Code:
allow booting: allow bootable 
allow bootp: allow bootable
authoritative: necessary for local
subnet and netmask:give what is your subnet and netmask
range: giving ip area
filename: booting filename
option tftp-server-name: tftp server address
option routers: give gateway address
next-server: give tftpserver address

and we should restart DHCP server.

sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server

DHCP server conf is done and we should look status of DHCP, and giving this information following code:

sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server

if status is okey , we can go TFTP settings.

------------Configuring TFTP settings-------------

We come TFTP server , and we install tftp server, you can do this following code:

sudo apt-get install tftpd-hpa

and we should start tftp service, this is giving following code to start:

sudo systemctl start tftpd-hpa

Now, we open giving directory file using what you want text editor, ı am using nano editor

sudo nano /etc/default/tftpd-hpa

and this following code:

#------------------------------------
TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
TFTP_DIRECTORY="/var/lib/tftpboot"
TFTP_ADDRESS=":69"
TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"
#-----------------------------------

Explaining Code:
TFTP_DIRECTORY: default directory for tftp server
TFTP_ADDRESS: communicate port

and we should restart service because of confihured file.

sudo systemctl restart tftpd-hpa

TFTP server conf is done and we should look status of TFTP, and giving this information following code:

sudo sytemctl status tftpd-hpa

If status is okey , we can go download debian10 buster image to tftp server.

-Download Image to Tftp server Directory and Unzip:
We have to go default tftp directory which means /var/lib/tftpboot  before download image. 
Then we download image writing this code:

wget ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/buster/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz

After that, we must untar this file.We can do it using this code:

tar -zxvf netboot.tar.gz

--------Preparing pxelinux.cfg file----------

The PXE configuration file defines the menu displayed to the target boots up and contacts the TFTP server. We open giving directory file using what you want text editor , I am using nano editor

sudo nano /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default  

and add following command.

#------------------------------------------------------------------
label preseed
  menu label ^Preseed install
  kernel debian-installer/amd64/linux
  append auto=true locale=tr_TR console-setup/charmap=UTF-8 console-keymaps-at/keymap=tr console-setup/layoutcode=tr console-setup/ask_detect=false pkgsel/language-pack-patterns=pkgsel/install-language-support=false interface=enp0s3 hostname=hostname01 domain="" url=tftp://10.0.2.102/buster.cfg DEBCONF_DEBUG=5 initrd=debian-installer/amd64/initrd.gz --- quiet
#-------------------------------------------------------------------
and save it
Explaining Code:
this code is giving configure before read preseed file. You can change after to use preseed file.If you want , change keyboard settings.url is important because of you take debian10 buster image from this server. Write your own tftp server ip adress instead of 10.0.2.102 and write your preseed file name and file directory instead of buster.cfg. Remember, we did default directory /var/lib/tftpboot for tftp server. For this reason, actually directory is /var/lib/tftpboot/buster.cfg  . You do not need write all directories of buster.cfg or what is yours. Enough to write preseed file name.


-Network BOOT Test
Firstly,Firstly we need to add Nat Network. First step, click to File , then click to Preferences. After that, click to Network. Second step click to add button (on the left square , green plus on button), then double click to coming new NatNetwork. You must unselect supports dhcp because of we have DHCP server. If you want change name what you want. Last step, click to all OK. Finally, click to settings of tftpserver machine on virtualbox, then click Network. Change attached to NAT Network instead of NAT, then choose your added name. After that click to all OK. You have to do same steps for DHCP server without add Nat Network steps. Start TFTP server and DHCP server. Make new machine ,  we need to change boot order this new mechine. First step, click to settings of new  machine on virtualbox, then click system. Second step, select tick for Network and scroll up Network to upper side. Last step, click the all OK and do giving before steps without add Nat Network steps and start it. If bootable screen come,Network BOOT Test is successfull. If is not , do again giving steps carefully. Finally, we are ready to prepare and test preseed file.



--------------Preparing preseed file-------------

You can make your own preseed file to use fallowing order. You have to add this file or own preseed file to 
/var/lib/tftpboot because of we set default directory to TFTP server. If booting machine ask boot steps to you 
when you booting your machine, you may be forget some steps in your preseed file. Check it.

### Partitioning
## Partitioning example
# If the system has free space you can choose to only partition that space.
# This is only honoured if partman-auto/method (below) is not set.
#d-i partman-auto/init_automatically_partition select 90%



# Alternatively, you may specify a disk to partition. If the system has only
# one disk the installer will default to using that, but otherwise the device
# name must be given in traditional, non-devfs format (so e.g. /dev/sda
# and not e.g. /dev/discs/disc0/disc).
# For example, to use the first SCSI/SATA hard disk:
#d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/sda
# In addition, you'll need to specify the method to use.
# The presently available methods are:
# - regular: use the usual partition types for your architecture
# - lvm:     use LVM to partition the disk
# - crypto:  use LVM within an encrypted partition
d-i partman-auto/method string lvm
d-i partman-auto-lvm/guided_size string max
# If one of the disks that are going to be automatically partitioned
# contains an old LVM configuration, the user will normally receive a
# warning. This can be preseeded away...
d-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean true
# The same applies to pre-existing software RAID array:
d-i partman-md/device_remove_md boolean true
# And the same goes for the confirmation to write the lvm partitions.
d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true
d-i partman-lvm/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true

# You can choose one of the three predefined partitioning recipes:
# - atomic: all files in one partition
# - home:   separate /home partition
# - multi:  separate /home, /var, and /tmp partitions
d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select atomic

# Or provide a recipe of your own...
# If you have a way to get a recipe file into the d-i environment, you can
# just point at it.
#d-i partman-auto/expert_recipe_file string /hd-media/recipe

# If not, you can put an entire recipe into the preconfiguration file in one
# (logical) line. This example creates a small /boot partition, suitable
# swap, and uses the rest of the space for the root partition:
#d-i partman-auto/expert_recipe string                         \
#      boot-root ::                                            \

-------------Preseed File Test-------------------
Just start DHCP,TFTP server machine and what you want boot machine.If it is working, congratulations you did it!!!

###################STEPS BEFORE PREPARE PRESEED FILE FOR CLONEZILLA########################3
We are using TFTP,DHCP,NFS server. We made TFTP,DHCP server and set conf file.Now, we need NFS server and set configure.

-----------------Making NFS server------------------
We need NFS server for read or save image file.First of all , make new machine and Ubuntu 18.04 server for NFS server on 
Virtualbox. We need to install nfs packet. 

sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server

Then we should make mount file,change own,change permission:

sudo mkdir -p /home/partimag

sudo chown nobody:nogroup /home/partimag

sudo chmod 777 /home/partimag

and we configure NFS server for mount file. Open /etc/exports using what you want text editor, I am using nano editor.

sudo nano /etc/exports

and add following this code:

/home/partimag *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

and save file.

rw: read and write operations   sync: write any change to the disc before applying it    no_subtree_check: prevent subtree checking
then we exports file with following code:

sudo exportfs -a

Finally, we should restart NFS server.

sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

NFS server configuration is done.

--------------Setting TFTP Server For Clonezilla Image--------------------
Follow steps:

Download Clonezilla.iso:

sudo wget https://osdn.net/projects/clonezilla/downloads/68292/clonezilla-live-2.5.2-31-amd64.iso -O clonezilla.iso

Mount it to /mnt

sudo mount -o loop clonezilla.iso /mnt

Create directory for clonezilla things to TFTP default directory:

sudo mkdir /var/lib/tftpboot/clonezilla

Copy some files to made directories:

sudo cp /mnt/live/{vmlinuz,initrd.img,filesystem.squashfs} /var/lib/tftpboot/clonezilla

setting is done.

--------------Preparing Clonezilla Preseed File--------------------------
Preparing clonezille preseed file is too easy. All preseed code writing to pxelinux.cfg conf file, and small chracter 
representation to process.Open pxelinux.cfg what you want to use text editor, I am using nano.

sudo nano /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default

add following Example code:

#------------------------------------------------------
label clone
  menu label Clone Disk
  kernel clonezilla/vmlinuz
  append initrd=clonezilla/initrd.img boot=live username=test union=overlay components noswap noprompt vga=788 keyboard-layouts=en locales=en_GB.UTF-8 fetch=tftp://10.0.2.102/clonezilla/filesystem.squashfs  ocs_repository="nfs://test@10.0.2.103/home/partimag" ocs_live_run="ocs-sr --batch -g auto -e1 auto -e2 -r -j2 -k -i 4096 -fsck -senc -p poweroff savedisk imagename sda"
#------------------------------------------------------

Explaining code:
fetch=tftp://10.0.2.102/clonezilla/filesystem.squashfs : writing for get clonezilla filesystem
ocs_repository="nfs://test@10.0.2.103/home/partimag" : save or read your image 
ocs_live_run="ocs-sr --batch -g auto -e1 auto -e2 -r -j2 -k -i 4096 -fsck -senc -p poweroff savedisk imagename sda" : this is 
your preseed, you configure this option inside. ocs-sr options:

To save or restore image

  ocs-sr [OPTION] {MODE} IMAGE_NAME DEVICE

Where MODE is one of
    savedisk
    saveparts
    restoredisk
    restoreparts

Options for saving:

  -noabo, --not-only-access-by-owner
      Make the image of partition can be accessed by others, not only by owner.
      By default the image of partition will be changed as 600. With this
      option, it will be 644.

  -senc, --skip-enc-ocs-img
      Skip encrypting the image with passphrase.

  -enc, --enc-ocs-img
      To encrypt the image with passphrase.

  -sfsck, --skip-fsck-src-part
      Skip running fsck on the source file system before saving it.

  -fsck, -fsck-src-part, --fsck-src-part
      Run fsck interactively on the source file system before saving it.

  -fsck-y, -fsck-src-part-y, --fsck-src-part-y
      Run fsck automatically on the source file system before saving it. This
      option will always attempt to fix any detected filesystem corruption
      automatically. //NOTE// Use this option in caution.

  -gm, --gen-md5sum
      Generate the MD5 checksum for the image. Later you can use -cm or
      --check-md5sum option to check the image when restoring the image.
      Note! It might take a lot of time to generate if the image size is
      large.

  -gs, --gen-sha1sum
      Generate the SHA1 checksum for the image. Later you can use -cs or
      --check-sha1sum option to check the image when restoring the image.
      Note! It might take a lot of time to generate if the image size is
      large.

  -gmf, --gen-chksum-for-files-in-dev
      Generate the checksum for files in the source device. Later you can use
      -cmf or --chk-chksum-for-files-in-dev to check the files in the
      destination device after they are restored. Note! It might take a lot of
      time to inspect the checksum if there are many files in the destination
      device.

  -i, --image-size SIZE
      Set the split image file volume size SIZE (MB). When ocs-sr is run with
      -x, the default SIZE is set as 4096, if without -x, we will not split
      it.  For storing on FAT32 filesystems, the SIZE should not be larger
      than 4096.

  -j2, --clone-hidden-data
      Use dd to clone the image of the data between MBR (1st sector, i.e. 512
      bytes) and 1st partition, which might be useful for some recovery tool.

  -ntfs-ok, --ntfs-ok
      Assume the NTFS integrity is OK, do NOT check again (for ntfsclone only)

  -rm-win-swap-hib, --rm-win-swap-hib
      Try to remove the MS windows swap file in the source partition.

  -q, --use-ntfsclone
      If the partition to be saved is NTFS, use program ntfsclone instead of
      partimage (i.e. Priority: ntfsclone > partimage > dd)

  -q1, --force-to-use-dd
      Force to use dd to save partition(s) (inefficient method, very slow, but
      works for all the file system).

  -q2, --use-partclone
      Use partclone to save partition(s) (i.e. partclone > partimage > dd).

  -rescue, --rescue
      Turn on rescue mode, i.e. try to skip bad sectors.

  -sc, -scs, --skip-check-restorable, --skip-check-restorable-s
      By default Clonezilla will check the image if restorable after it is
      created. This option allows you to skip that.

  -z0, --no-compress
      Don't compress when saving: fast but very big image file
  -z1, --gzip-compress
      Compress using gzip when saving (default)
  -z1p, --smp-gzip-compress
      Compress using parallel gzip program (pigz) for multi-cpu machines
  -z2, --bz2-compress
      Compress using bzip2 when saving: slow but smallest image file
  -z2p, --smp-bzip2-compress
      Compress using parallel bzip2 program (pbzip2) for multi-cpu machines
  -z3, --lzo-compress
      Compress using lzop when saving: similar to gzip but faster
  -z4, --lzma-compress
      Compress using lzma when saving: similar to bzip but faster
  -z5, --xz-compress
      Compress using xz when saving: faster decompression than bzip2.
  -z5p, --smp-xz-compress
      Compress using parallel xz when saving
  -z6, --lzip-compress
      Compress using lzip when saving: faster decompression than bzip2.
  -z6p, --smp-lzip-compress
      Compress using parallel lzip when saving
  -z7, --lrzip-compress
      Compress using lrzip when saving.


Some words are reserved for IMAGE_NAME, "ask_user" is used to let user to
input a name when saving an image. "autoname" is used to automatically
generate the image name based on network card MAC address and time.
"autohostname" is used to automatically generate the image name based on
hostname. "autoproductname" is used to automatically generate the image name
based on hardware product model gotten from dmidecode.

A word is reserved for DEVICE, "ask_user" could be used to let user to select
the source device when saving an image.


Options for restoring:

  -f, --from-part-in-img PARTITION
      Restore the partition from image. This is especially for "restoreparts"
      to restore the image of partition (only works for one) to different
      partition, e.g. sda1 of image to sdb6.

 -g, --grub-install GRUB_PARTITION
      Install grub in the MBR of the disk containing partition GRUB_PARTITION
      with root grub directory in the same GRUB_PARTITION when restoration
      finishes, GRUB_PARTITION can be one of "/dev/sda1", "/dev/sda2"... or
      "auto" ("auto" will let clonezilla detect the grub root partition
      automatically). If "auto" is assigned, it will work if grub partition
      and root partition are not in the same partition.

  -r, --resize-partition
      Resize the partition when restoration finishes, this will resize the
      file system size to fit the partition size. It is normally used when
      when a small partition image is restored to a larger partition.

  -k, --no-fdisk, --no-create-partition
      Do NOT create partition in target harddisk. If this option is set, you
      must make sure there is an existing partition table in the current
      restored harddisk. Default is to create the partition table.

  -icrc, --icrc
      Skip Partclone CRC checking.

  -irhr, --irhr
      Skip removing the Linux udev hardware records on the restored GNU/Linux.

  -irvd, --irvd
      Skip removing the NTFS volume dirty flag after file system is restored.

  -ius, --ius
      Skip updating syslinux-related files on the restored GNU/Linux.

  -icds, --ignore-chk-dsk-size-pt
      Skip checking destination disk size before creating the partition table
      on it. By default it will be checked and if the size is smaller than the
      source disk, quit.

  -iefi, --ignore-update-efi-nvram
      Skip updating boot entries in EFI NVRAM after restoring.

  -k1
      Create partition table in the target disk proportionally.

  -k2
      Enter command line prompt to create partition table manually before
      restoring image.

  -t, --no-restore-mbr
      Do NOT restore the MBR (Mater Boot Record) when restoring image. If this
      option is set, you must make sure there is an existing MBR in the
      current restored harddisk.   Default is Yes.  See -g above

  -u, --select-img-in-client
      Input the image name in clients

  -e, --load-geometry
      Force to use the saved CHS (cylinders, heads, sectors) when using sfdisk

  -e1, --change-geometry NTFS-BOOT-PARTITION
     Force to change the CHS (cylinders, heads, sectors) value of NTFS boot
     partition after image is restored. NTFS-BOOT-PARTITION can be one of
     "/dev/sda1", "/dev/sda2"... or "auto" ("auto" will let clonezilla detect
     the NTFS boot partition automatically)

  -e2, --load-geometry-from-edd
     Force to use the CHS (cylinders, heads, sectors) from EDD (Enhanced Disk
     Device) when creating partition table by sfdisk

  -y, -y0, --always-restore, --always-restore-default-local
     Let Clonezilla server as restore server, i.e. client will always has
     restore mode to choose (However default mode in PXE menu is local boot)

  -y1, --always-restore-default-clone
     Let Clonezilla server as restore server, i.e. client will always has
     restore mode to choose (The default mode in PXE menu is clone, so if
     client boots, it will enter clone always, i.e. clone forever)

  -j, --create-part-by-sfdisk
     Use sfdisk to create partition table instead of using dd to dump the
     partition table from saved image (This is default)

  -j0, --create-part-by-dd
     Use dd to dump the partition table from saved image instead of sfdisk.
     ///Note/// This does NOT work when logical drives exist.

  -j1, --dump-mbr-in-the-end
     Use dd to dump the MBR (total 512 bytes, i.e. 446 bytes (executable code
     area) + 64 bytes (table of primary partitions) + 2 bytes (MBR signature;
     # 0xAA55) = 512 bytes) after disk image was restored. This is an
     insurance for some hard drive has different numbers of cylinder, head and
     sector between image was saved and restored.

  -j2, --clone-hidden-data
     Use dd to clone the image of the data between MBR (1st sector, i.e. 512
     bytes) and 1st partition, which might be useful for some recovery tool.

  -hn0 PREFIX
     Change the hostname of M$ Windows based on the combination of hostname
     prefix and IP address, i.e. PREFIX-IP

  -hn1 PREFIX
     Change the hostname of M$ Windows based on the combination of hostname
     prefix and NIC MAC address, i.e. PREFIX-MAC

  --max-time-to-wait TIME
     When not enough clients have connected (but at least one), start anyways
     when TIME seconds since first client connection have pased. This option
     is used with --clients-to-wait

  -scr, --skip-check-restorable-r
      By default Clonezilla will check the image if restorable before
      restoring. This option allows you to skip that.

  -cm, --check-md5sum
     Check the MD5 checksum for the image. To use this option, you must enable
     -gm|--gen-md5sum option when the image is saved. Note! It might take
     a lot of time to check if the image size is large.

  -cs, --check-sha1sum
     Check the SHA1 checksum for the image. To use this option, you must
     enable -gs or --gen-sha1sum option when the image is saved. Note! It
     might take a lot of time to check if the image size is large.

  -cmf, --chk-chksum-for-files-in-dev
     Check the checksum for the files in the device. To use this option, you
     must enable -gmf or --gen-chksum-for-files-in-dev when the image is saved.
     Note! (1) The file system must be supported by Linux kernel so that it
     can be mounted as read-only to check the files. (2) It might take a lot
     of time to check if there are many files in the source device.

  -srel, --save-restore-error-log
     Save the error log file in the image dir. By default the log file won't
     be saved when error occurs.

  --mcast-port NO
     Assign the udp port number for multicast restore. This is used by
     clonezilla server. Normally it's not necessary to manually assign this
     option.

Some words are reserved for IMAGE_NAME, "ask_user" is used to let user to
input a name when saving an image. "autoproductname" is used to automatically
get the image name based on hardware product model from dmidecode.

A word is reserved for DEVICE, "ask_user" could be used to let user to select
the source device when saving an image.

  -b, -batch, --batch
      (DANGEROUS!) Run program in batch mode, i.e. without any prompt or wait
      for pressing enter key.  //NOTE// You have to use '-batch' instead of
